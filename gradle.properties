# Testing against 3.3.2 for the 2.0.0 release as 3.3.0 was released in June 2022 and 3.3.2 in February 2023, while
# 3.4.0 is fairly new - April 2023. And at least AWS Glue and EMR are only on 3.3.0. But 3.3.2 has bug fixes that
# affect some of our tests - see PushDownGroupByCountTest for an example. So we're choosing to build and test
# against the latest 3.3.x release so we're not writing assertions based on buggy behavior in Spark 3.3.0.
