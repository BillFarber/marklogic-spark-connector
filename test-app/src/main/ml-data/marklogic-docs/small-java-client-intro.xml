  <text>The Java API provides a handle (a kind of adapter) as a uniform interface for content representation. As a result,
    you can use APIs as different as InputStream and DOM to provide content for one read() or write() method. In
    addition, you can extend the Java API so you can use the existing read() or write() methods with new APIs that
    provide useful representations for your content.
