  <text>When working with the Java API, you first create a manager for the type of document or operation you want to
    perform on the database (for instance, a JSONDocumentManager to write and read JSON documents or a QueryManager to
    search the database). To write or read the content for a database operation, you use standard Java APIs such as
    InputStream, DOM, StAX, JAXB, and Transformer as well as Open Source APIs such as JDOM and Jackson.
