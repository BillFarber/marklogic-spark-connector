MarkLogic Server  Requirements and Database Compatibility

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
1. Requirements and Database Compatibility

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
This chapter introduces MarkLogic Server, lists the product requirements and supported platforms, and
describes the database compatibility with previous releases. It includes the following sections:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
• Introduction
• MarkLogic Server Assumptions
• Memory, Disk Space, and Swap Space Requirements
• Supported Platforms
• Supported Filesystems
• Supported Browsers
• Java Virtual Machine Requirements
• Upgrades and Database Compatibility
• MarkLogic Converters Installation Changes Starting at Release 9.0-4

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
1.1. Introduction
MarkLogic Server is a powerful NoSQL database for harnessing your digital content base, complete
with enterprise features demanded by real-world, mission-critical applications. MarkLogic enables you
to build complex applications that interact with large volumes of content in JSON, XML, SGML, HTML,
and other popular content formats, as well as binary formats. The unique architecture of MarkLogic
ensures that your applications are both scalable and high performance, delivering query results at
search-engine speeds while providing transactional integrity over the underlying content repository.
MarkLogic can be configured for a distributed environment, enabling you to scale your infrastructure
through hardware expansion.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
This installation guide explains the procedures needed to install MarkLogic on your system. It is
intended for a technical audience. This document explains how to install the software, not how to
use the software. To learn how to get started using the software, see the rest of the MarkLogic
documentation (available on docs.marklogic.com), including the following documents:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
• What's New
• Getting Started with MarkLogic Server
• Concepts Guide
• Administrator's Guide
• Getting Started with Optic
• Application Developer's Guide
• Search Developer's Guide
• JavaScript Reference Guide
• MarkLogic XQuery and XSLT Function Reference

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
1.2. MarkLogic Server Assumptions
During the installation process, MarkLogic sets memory and other settings based on the characteristics
of the computer in which it is running. MarkLogic is a scalable, multi-threaded server product, and as
such it assumes it has the entire machine available to it, including the CPU and disk I/O capacity. It
is important to follow the guidelines as described. Furthermore, MarkLogic assumes there is only one
MarkLogic Server process running on any given machine, so it is not recommended to run multiple
instances of MarkLogic on a single machine.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
MarkLogic Server expects the system clocks to be synchronized across all the nodes in a cluster. The
clock skew should be less than 0.5 seconds. You should use a time service such as NTP to keep
your system clocks synchronized. For more details, see the following Knowledge Base article: https://
help.marklogic.com/knowledgebase/article/View/24/15/synchronizing-system-clocks-in-a-cluster.

MarkLogic Server  Memory, Disk Space, and Swap Space
Requirements

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
1.3. Memory, Disk Space, and Swap Space Requirements
Before installing the software, be sure that your system meets the following requirements:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
• For a production deployment, MarkLogic recommends at least 8 vCPUs per host, with 8 GB of
memory per vCPU. For example, for a production host with 16 vCPUs the recommended memory
is at least 128 GB. For bare-metal systems, a hardware thread (hyperthread), is equivalent to a
vCPU. Use memory optimized cloud compute instances or virtual machines. Memory requirements
may increase over time as projects evolve and databases grow with more content and more indexes.
See comment 1 in the following table.
• For a prototyping or development deployment, MarkLogic requires a minimum of 4 GB of system
memory and recommends at least 8 GB of memory. See comment 1 in the following table.
• For small forests that will not grow, such as Security and Schemas, the reserve size is two times the
size of the forest.
For data forests, we recommend a size of 500 GB, where 400 GB is allocated to content, and 100 GB
is left as reserved space to handle merges. See comment 2 in the following table for details about this
storage calculation.
• On Linux systems, you need at least as much swap space as the amount of physical memory on the
machine or 32 GB, whichever is lower.
If you have Huge Pages set up on a Linux system, your swap space on that machine must be at least
the size of your physical memory minus the size of your Huge Pages (because Linux Huge Pages are
not swapped), or 32 GB, whichever is lower. For example, if you have 48 GB of physical memory, and
if you have Huge Pages set to 18 GB, then you need swap space of 30 GB (48 - 18). For details on
setting up Huge Pages, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1578873 on the Red Hat website.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
NOTE
A Red Hat subscription is required to view the content on the Web page.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
At system startup on Linux machines, MarkLogic Server logs a message to the ErrorLog.txt
file showing the size of the Huge Pages, and the message indicates if the size is below the
recommended level.
If you are using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, you must turn off Transparent Huge Pages (Transparent
Huge Pages are configured automatically by the operating system). For details on disabling
Transparent Huge Pages, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1320153.
• On Windows systems, twice the physical memory is also recommended for the swap (page) file. For
Windows 10, you configure this by searching for View Advanced System Settings in the taskbar.
Next, click the icon. Then, in the Performance area, click Settings &gt; Advanced and set the virtual
memory to twice the physical memory. For earlier Windows systems, click System Control Panel &gt;
Advanced System Settings &gt; Performance Settings &gt; Advanced tab and set the virtual memory
settings to twice the physical memory.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
No  Comment
[1]  MarkLogic automatically configures itself to reserve as much system memory as it can the first time it runs. If you need to
change the default configuration, you can manually override these defaults later, using the Admin Interface.
[2]  For content forests that are expected to grow over time, with the default merge settings, you need to reserve 100 GB of
storage. Here is the calculation:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
You need at least 2 times the merge max size of free space per forest, regardless of the forest size. Therefore, with
the default merge max size of 48 GB, you need at least 96 GB of free space. Additionally, if your journals are not yet
created, you need 2 times the journal size of free disk space (if the journal space is not yet allocated). Therefore, to be
safe, you need 100 GB of free space for each content forest.

</xhtml:p>

MarkLogic Server  Supported Browsers

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
NOTE
The Solaris OS is not supported.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
1.6. Supported Browsers
The following browsers are supported:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
• Google Chrome
• Mozilla Firefox
• Microsoft Edge

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
1.7. Java Virtual Machine Requirements
MarkLogic Server can function with or without a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The only requirement
needed for a JVM to be installed on MarkLogic Server would be if you use HDFS (Hadoop Distributed
File System).

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Our provided Amazon AMIs have a JDK pre-installed that is used during the MarkLogic bootstrap
process to setup and configure MarkLogic in the Amazon environment. Therefore, you do not need to
install a JVM on any EC2 instance.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
The following MarkLogic products and features require a JVM to either run or install:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
• Gradle (https://developer.marklogic.com/code/ml-gradle/)
• DHF (https://marklogic.github.io/marklogic-data-hub/)

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
MarkLogic supports the Java 8, 9, 10, and 11 versions of the following JVMs:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
• Oracle/Sun
• OpenJDK 

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
NOTE
The IBM JRE is not supported.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
By default, MarkLogic looks for Java in the location specified via the JAVA_HOME environment variable
or in a specific set of default locations. If JAVA_HOME is not set in the startup environment, MarkLogic
uses the first JRE or JDK found in one of the following locations. These locations are searched in the
order listed.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
• /usr/java/default
• /usr/java/latest
• /usr/java/jdk1.N*

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
*where N is a supported Java version. For example, /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_202.
• /usr/lib/jvm/java
• /usr/lib/jvm/java-openjdk
• /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.N.0-*.x86_64

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
*where N is a supported Java version, such as Java 8.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
If you have Java installed in a different location, you can communicate your JAVA_HOME to MarkLogic
through the file /etc/marklogic.conf. For example:

MarkLogic Server  Upgrades and Database Compatibility

cat &gt; /etc/marklogic.conf
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
1.8. Upgrades and Database Compatibility
MarkLogic 11 supports upgrades from MarkLogic 9.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
During the upgrade, the Security database, the Schemas database, and the configuration files are
automatically upgraded. The Security database is upgraded with the latest execute privileges and the
Schemas database is upgraded with the latest version of the Schemas used by MarkLogic Server. The
upgrade occurs as part of the installation procedure.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Databases that contain your own content are also upgraded; once you upgrade, you will no longer be
able to use that database with previous versions of MarkLogic.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
NOTE
MarkLogic Corporation strongly recommends performing a backup of your databases
before upgrading. Additionally, MarkLogic Corporation recommends that you first
upgrade to the latest maintenance release of the major version of MarkLogic you are
running before upgrading.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
For the procedure for upgrading, see Upgrading from Previous Releases. For details about known
incompatibilities, see What's New.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
1.9. MarkLogic Converters Installation Changes Starting at
Release 9.0-4
MarkLogic Converters are used to convert Microsoft Office Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents,
as well as Adobe PDF files, to XHTML. MarkLogic filters are used to filter a variety of document
formats, extract metadata and text from them, and return XHTML. The following MarkLogic XQuery API
functions, described in the MarkLogic XQuery and XSLT Function Reference, provide this functionality:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
xdmp:word-convert
xdmp:excel-convert
xdmp:powerpoint-convert
xdmp:pdf-convert
xdmp:document-filter

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Converters/filters are also used as part of the conversion pipeline in Content Processing Framework.
For more details, see The Default Conversion Option in the Content Processing Framework Guide.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Prior to MarkLogic release 9.0-4, converters/filters were bundled and automatically installed with
MarkLogic Server. Starting with MarkLogic release 9.0-4, converters/filters are offered as a separate
package: MarkLogic Converters.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
This change provides better flexibility and enables you to install/uninstall MarkLogic converters/filters
separately from MarkLogic Server.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
With this change, MarkLogic Server does not include MarkLogic Converters. To use converters/filters,
install both packages: MarkLogic Server and MarkLogic Converters. An XDMP-CVTNOTFOUND error will
be thrown upon an attempt to use converters/filters on a MarkLogic node with no MarkLogic Converters
installed.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
The version of MarkLogic Converters is synchronized with the version of MarkLogic Server. For
example, MarkLogic Converters 9.0-4 corresponds to MarkLogic Server 9.0-4 and may be installed
with it.

MarkLogic Server  MarkLogic Converters Installation Changes Starting
at Release 9.0-4

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
You can obtain the version of MarkLogic Converters installed on a node by calling to MarkLogic
server-side API function xdmp:host-status and examining the value of the converters-version
element in the response. If the converters package is not installed on a node, the convertersversion element will be empty.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
MarkLogic Converters packages for all supported platforms are available for download at the same
location where MarkLogic Server packages are available, namely at http://developer.marklogic.com.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
If you want to use the converters package with MarkLogic 9.0-4 or later, you will have to perform a
two-step installation: first install MarkLogic Server and then install MarkLogic Converters.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
For details on MarkLogic Server and MarkLogic Converters installation for all supported platforms, see
Installing MarkLogic.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
If you want to uninstall MarkLogic 9.0-4 or later, and if the converters package was previously installed
with it, you will have to perform a two-step uninstall: first uninstall MarkLogic Converters and then
uninstall MarkLogic Server.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
For details on uninstalling MarkLogic Server and MarkLogic Converters, see Removing MarkLogic.

2. Procedures

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
This section describes the following procedures to install MarkLogic on your system.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
• Upgrading from Previous Releases
• Installing MarkLogic
• Starting MarkLogic Server
• Configuring the First and Subsequent Hosts
• Entering a License Key
• Checking for the Correct Software Version
• Configuring MarkLogic Server to Run as a Non-Daemon User
• Removing MarkLogic

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
2.1. Upgrading from Previous Releases
If you have previously installed MarkLogic on a machine, you must uninstall the old release before
proceeding with the new installation. For information on removing the software, see Removing
MarkLogic or the Installation Guide from the previous release. This section describes the following
information and upgrade paths:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
• Windows Service Parameters
• Upgrading from Release 9.0-1 or Later
• Upgrading Clusters with DB Replication Configured

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
If you are upgrading a cluster to a new release, see Upgrading a Cluster to a New Maintenance
Release of MarkLogic Server in the Scalability, Availability, and Failover Guide. The Security database
and the Schemas database must be on the same host, and that host should be the first host you
upgrade when upgrading a cluster.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
WARNING
MarkLogic Server does not support downgrades. Once you have upgraded to a later
release, you cannot downgrade to a previous version. To retain the option to restore to
a previous version of MarkLogic Server, make a complete backup of your content and
security databases before upgrading.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
2.1.1. Windows Service Parameters
When you upgrade MarkLogic on Windows as a different user from the user that installed the
previous version, the MarkLogic service parameters in the Windows registry will be changed. When
the old version of MarkLogic is uninstalled, the service is deleted from the registry, including any
customizations to the service parameters. When the new version of MarkLogic is installed, the service
is re-created in the registry, with the default service parameters.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Before starting the upgraded version of MarkLogic, make any customization to the service parameters.
Otherwise, the default service parameters will be set and MarkLogic will start up running as the local
system user. Any MarkLogic configuration files saved as the local system user (such as those modified
when making changes in the Admin Interface) will be created with the Windows file permissions for the
local system user.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
If you are upgrading a cluster to a new release, see Upgrading a Cluster to a New Maintenance
Release of MarkLogic Server in the Scalability, Availability, and Failover Guide. The Security database
and the Schemas database must be on the same host, and that host should be the first host you
upgrade when upgrading a cluster.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
NOTE
It is not recommended to install the converters while MarkLogic Server is running.
The reason for this is that the server checks the converters presence and version
number only upon start-up. So, the server will not have accurate information about the
converters in this case. The recommended installation procedure is to stop the server if
it is running, install or upgrade the server, install the converters, then start the server.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
The following table shows the installation directory (&lt;marklogic-dir&gt;) and the default data directory
for each platform:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Platform

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Windows
Red Hat Linux
Mac OS X 

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Installation Directory

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
c:\Program Files\MarkLogic\
/opt/MarkLogic
~/Library/MarkLogic 

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Default Data Directory

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
for configuration and log files
c:\Program Files\MarkLogic\Data
/var/opt/MarkLogic
~/Library/Application Support/MarkLogic/Data

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
The default forest directory is the same as the default data directory if the optional data directory is
not specified during forest creation. On UNIX platforms, if you want MarkLogic Server to use another
location for its default data directory, make your data directory (/var/opt/MarkLogic on Linux) a soft
link to the alternate location.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
In MarkLogic release 9.0-4 and later, MarkLogic Converters installation directory remains the same as
in previous releases, namely:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Platform
Windows
Red Hat Linux
Mac OS X 

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Converters Installation Directory
c:\Program Files\MarkLogic\Converters
/opt/MarkLogic/Converters
~/Library/MarkLogic/Converters

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
NOTE
When a new node joins an existing cluster, the server does not try to figure out
automatically whether the MarkLogic Converters package is needed or not. An XDMPCVTNOTFOUND error will be thrown if converters/filters built-in functions are called on
nodes that do not have MarkLogic Converters installed.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>

2.4.2. Configuring an Additional Host in a Cluster
All hosts in a cluster have to be on the same platform. To configure this installation as an additional host
in a cluster of the same platform, perform the following steps:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
1. On the node you want to add to an existing cluster, install and start MarkLogic as described in
Installing MarkLogic and Starting MarkLogic Server.
2. Log into the Admin Interface in a browser. It is on port 8001 of the host in which MarkLogic is

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
2.4.3. Leaving a Cluster and Becoming a Single Host
If your host is currently in a cluster of multiple hosts, and you would like to leave the cluster and switch
to a single host environment, follow the steps in this section.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
A host cannot leave a cluster if there are still forests assigned to it or if it has any foreign clusters
associated with it. You must delete all forests assigned to the host and de-couple any clusters
associated with a host before you can leave the cluster. However, if you delete only the configuration
for a forest, the forest data will remain on the filesystem, allowing you to add the forest back to the host

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>

<xhtml:p>
after changing the configuration. For instructions on adding a forest to a host, see the Administrator’s
Guide.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Perform the following steps to leave the cluster to which a host is connected:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
1. Run the Admin Interface from the host you want to remove from the cluster.
2. Click the Hosts icon in the left menu tree. The Host Summary page appears.
3. Click the name of the host you want to remove from the cluster, either from the left menu tree or
from the Host Summary page. The Host Configuration page appears:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
4. Click the Leave button.
5. Click OK to confirm leaving the cluster.
6. The host restarts to load the new configuration.
7. Follow the instructions in sections Configuring a Single Host or the First Host in a Cluster or
Configuring an Additional Host in a Cluster as appropriate.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
2.5. Entering a License Key
MarkLogic will run without a license key, but after installing MarkLogic, you should enter a valid license
key for the usage and features for which you are licensed. At any time, you can change the license key
for a host from the Host Status page.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
These are some reasons that you would need to change your license key:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
• Your license key has expired.
• You need to use some features that are not covered by your existing license key.
• You upgraded your hardware with more CPUs and/or more cores.
• You need a license that covers a larger database.
• You require different languages.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Changing the license key sometimes results in an automatic restart of MarkLogic (for example, if your
new license enables a new language).

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
You have successfully installed MarkLogic onto your system.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
To begin using MarkLogic Server, see Getting Started with MarkLogic Server.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
2.7. Configuring MarkLogic Server to Run as a Non-Daemon
User
On UNIX-based systems (Linux), MarkLogic runs as the UNIX user named daemon. This section
describes how to change a configuration to run as a different UNIX user. This procedure must be run by
the root user. Additionally, the root user is still required for installing and uninstalling MarkLogic and
for starting and stopping MarkLogic from the startup scripts.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
To modify an installation to run as a user other than daemon, perform the following steps:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
1. In a command window on the machine in which you installed MarkLogic, log in as the root user.
2. Make sure MarkLogic is stopped. If it is still running, stop it as follows:

MarkLogic Server  Configuring MarkLogic Server to Run as a NonDaemon User

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Platfrom
Red Hat Linux 
Steps
As the root user, enter the following command:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
/sbin/service MarkLogic stop
3. Edit the configuration file for your platform using a text editor such as vi.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Platform
Red Hat Linux  /etc/marklogic.conf 

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Configuration file

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
NOTE
You must create the /etc/marklogic.conf file if it does not exist. The file is
only read by the MarkLogic startup: it is never written to. Therefore, it will survive
uninstalling MarkLogic.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
4. In the file /etc/marklogic.conf, add or edit the MARKLOGIC_USER environment variable to
point to the user in which you want MarkLogic Server to run. For example, if you want it to run as a
user named raymond, change the following line:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
export MARKLOGIC_USER=daemon

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
to the following:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
export MARKLOGIC_USER=raymond
5. Save the changes to the /etc/marklogic.conf file.
6. If you have not yet started MarkLogic after performing a clean installation (that is, after installing
into a directory where MarkLogic has never been installed), then you are done and you can skip
the rest of the steps in this procedure. If you have an existing installation (for example, if you are
upgrading to a maintenance release), then continue with the following steps.
7. For all of the MarkLogic files owned by daemon, you need to change the owner to the new user.
This includes all forest data and all of the configuration files. By default, the forest data is in the
following directories:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Platform  Configuration file
Red Hat Linux  /var/opt/marklogic
8. For example, on a Linux system, perform a command similar to the following, which changes the
owner to the user specified earlier in the /etc//MarkLogic.conf file:

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
chown -R raymond /var/opt/MarkLogic
9. Make sure to change the owner for all forests in the system; otherwise, forests will fail to mount
upon startup. Note that the above command only changes the owner for forests installed in the
default directory. You need to run a similar command on the data directory for each forest in which
a data directory is specified.
10. When you have completed all the file and directory ownership changes, start MarkLogic as
described in Starting MarkLogic Server.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
Once you have performed this procedure, all new files created by MarkLogic are created with the new
user ownership; there will be no need to change any ownership again.

WARNING
On Linux systems, use the /etc/marklogic.conf script to set environment
variables. Any configuration changes you make to the MarkLogic-supplied startup
script (for example, /etc/sysconfig/MarkLogic) will not survive an upgrade and
need to be merged in during any upgrade of MarkLogic (because the installation
installs a new version of the startup scripts). Under Linux, the uninstallation
process saves an old version of the scripts (for example, /etc/sysconfig/
MarkLogic.rpmsave), so you can use that version to merge in your changes. If you
perform a clean installation (not an upgrade installation), however, you will need to run
this entire procedure again. If you use /etc/marklogic.conf for your environment
variable changes, they will survive an upgrade and you will not need to merge your
changes.

</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>
The following are default values of environment variables you can override in /etc/marklogic.conf
on Linux-based systems (you will have to create the file if it does not exist):

</xhtml:p>

MarkLogic Server  Requirements and Database Compatibility

</p>
<p>
1. Requirements and Database Compatibility

</p>
<p>
This chapter introduces MarkLogic Server, lists the product requirements and supported platforms, and
describes the database compatibility with previous releases. It includes the following sections:

</p>
<p>
• Introduction
• MarkLogic Server Assumptions
• Memory, Disk Space, and Swap Space Requirements
• Supported Platforms
• Supported Filesystems
• Supported Browsers
• Java Virtual Machine Requirements
• Upgrades and Database Compatibility
• MarkLogic Converters Installation Changes Starting at Release 9.0-4

</p>
<p>
1.1. Introduction
MarkLogic Server is a powerful NoSQL database for harnessing your digital content base, complete
with enterprise features demanded by real-world, mission-critical applications. MarkLogic enables you
to build complex applications that interact with large volumes of content in JSON, XML, SGML, HTML,
and other popular content formats, as well as binary formats. The unique architecture of MarkLogic
ensures that your applications are both scalable and high performance, delivering query results at
search-engine speeds while providing transactional integrity over the underlying content repository.
MarkLogic can be configured for a distributed environment, enabling you to scale your infrastructure
through hardware expansion.

</p>
<p>
This installation guide explains the procedures needed to install MarkLogic on your system. It is
intended for a technical audience. This document explains how to install the software, not how to
use the software. To learn how to get started using the software, see the rest of the MarkLogic
documentation (available on docs.marklogic.com), including the following documents:

</p>
<p>
• What's New
• Getting Started with MarkLogic Server
• Concepts Guide
• Administrator's Guide
• Getting Started with Optic
• Application Developer's Guide
• Search Developer's Guide
• JavaScript Reference Guide
• MarkLogic XQuery and XSLT Function Reference

</p>
<p>
1.2. MarkLogic Server Assumptions
During the installation process, MarkLogic sets memory and other settings based on the characteristics
of the computer in which it is running. MarkLogic is a scalable, multi-threaded server product, and as
such it assumes it has the entire machine available to it, including the CPU and disk I/O capacity. It
is important to follow the guidelines as described. Furthermore, MarkLogic assumes there is only one
MarkLogic Server process running on any given machine, so it is not recommended to run multiple
instances of MarkLogic on a single machine.

</p>
<p>
MarkLogic Server expects the system clocks to be synchronized across all the nodes in a cluster. The
clock skew should be less than 0.5 seconds. You should use a time service such as NTP to keep
your system clocks synchronized. For more details, see the following Knowledge Base article: https://
help.marklogic.com/knowledgebase/article/View/24/15/synchronizing-system-clocks-in-a-cluster.

MarkLogic Server  Memory, Disk Space, and Swap Space
Requirements

</p>
<p>
1.3. Memory, Disk Space, and Swap Space Requirements
Before installing the software, be sure that your system meets the following requirements:

</p>
<p>
• For a production deployment, MarkLogic recommends at least 8 vCPUs per host, with 8 GB of
memory per vCPU. For example, for a production host with 16 vCPUs the recommended memory
is at least 128 GB. For bare-metal systems, a hardware thread (hyperthread), is equivalent to a
vCPU. Use memory optimized cloud compute instances or virtual machines. Memory requirements
may increase over time as projects evolve and databases grow with more content and more indexes.
See comment 1 in the following table.
• For a prototyping or development deployment, MarkLogic requires a minimum of 4 GB of system
memory and recommends at least 8 GB of memory. See comment 1 in the following table.
• For small forests that will not grow, such as Security and Schemas, the reserve size is two times the
size of the forest.
For data forests, we recommend a size of 500 GB, where 400 GB is allocated to content, and 100 GB
is left as reserved space to handle merges. See comment 2 in the following table for details about this
storage calculation.
• On Linux systems, you need at least as much swap space as the amount of physical memory on the
machine or 32 GB, whichever is lower.
If you have Huge Pages set up on a Linux system, your swap space on that machine must be at least
the size of your physical memory minus the size of your Huge Pages (because Linux Huge Pages are
not swapped), or 32 GB, whichever is lower. For example, if you have 48 GB of physical memory, and
if you have Huge Pages set to 18 GB, then you need swap space of 30 GB (48 - 18). For details on
setting up Huge Pages, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1578873 on the Red Hat website.

</p>
<p>
NOTE
A Red Hat subscription is required to view the content on the Web page.

</p>
<p>
At system startup on Linux machines, MarkLogic Server logs a message to the ErrorLog.txt
file showing the size of the Huge Pages, and the message indicates if the size is below the
recommended level.
If you are using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, you must turn off Transparent Huge Pages (Transparent
Huge Pages are configured automatically by the operating system). For details on disabling
Transparent Huge Pages, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1320153.
• On Windows systems, twice the physical memory is also recommended for the swap (page) file. For
Windows 10, you configure this by searching for View Advanced System Settings in the taskbar.
Next, click the icon. Then, in the Performance area, click Settings &gt; Advanced and set the virtual
memory to twice the physical memory. For earlier Windows systems, click System Control Panel &gt;
Advanced System Settings &gt; Performance Settings &gt; Advanced tab and set the virtual memory
settings to twice the physical memory.

</p>
<p>
No  Comment
[1]  MarkLogic automatically configures itself to reserve as much system memory as it can the first time it runs. If you need to
change the default configuration, you can manually override these defaults later, using the Admin Interface.
[2]  For content forests that are expected to grow over time, with the default merge settings, you need to reserve 100 GB of
storage. Here is the calculation:

</p>
<p>
You need at least 2 times the merge max size of free space per forest, regardless of the forest size. Therefore, with
the default merge max size of 48 GB, you need at least 96 GB of free space. Additionally, if your journals are not yet
created, you need 2 times the journal size of free disk space (if the journal space is not yet allocated). Therefore, to be
safe, you need 100 GB of free space for each content forest.

</p>
<p>
1.4. Supported Platforms
MarkLogic Server is supported on the following platforms:

MarkLogic Server  Supported Browsers

</p>
<p>
NOTE
The Solaris OS is not supported.

</p>
<p>
1.6. Supported Browsers
The following browsers are supported:

</p>
<p>
• Google Chrome
• Mozilla Firefox
• Microsoft Edge

</p>
<p>
1.7. Java Virtual Machine Requirements
MarkLogic Server can function with or without a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The only requirement
needed for a JVM to be installed on MarkLogic Server would be if you use HDFS (Hadoop Distributed
File System).

</p>
<p>
Our provided Amazon AMIs have a JDK pre-installed that is used during the MarkLogic bootstrap
process to setup and configure MarkLogic in the Amazon environment. Therefore, you do not need to
install a JVM on any EC2 instance.

</p>
<p>
The following MarkLogic products and features require a JVM to either run or install:

</p>
<p>
• Gradle (https://developer.marklogic.com/code/ml-gradle/)
• DHF (https://marklogic.github.io/marklogic-data-hub/)

</p>
<p>
MarkLogic supports the Java 8, 9, 10, and 11 versions of the following JVMs:

</p>
<p>
• Oracle/Sun
• OpenJDK 

</p>
<p>
NOTE
The IBM JRE is not supported.

</p>
<p>
By default, MarkLogic looks for Java in the location specified via the JAVA_HOME environment variable
or in a specific set of default locations. If JAVA_HOME is not set in the startup environment, MarkLogic
uses the first JRE or JDK found in one of the following locations. These locations are searched in the
order listed.

</p>
<p>
• /usr/java/default
• /usr/java/latest
• /usr/java/jdk1.N*

</p>
<p>
*where N is a supported Java version. For example, /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_202.
• /usr/lib/jvm/java
• /usr/lib/jvm/java-openjdk
• /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.N.0-*.x86_64

</p>
<p>
*where N is a supported Java version, such as Java 8.

</p>
<p>
If you have Java installed in a different location, you can communicate your JAVA_HOME to MarkLogic
through the file /etc/marklogic.conf. For example:

MarkLogic Server  Upgrades and Database Compatibility

</p>
<p>
cat &gt; /etc/marklogic.conf
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk

</p>
<p>
1.8. Upgrades and Database Compatibility
MarkLogic 11 supports upgrades from MarkLogic 9.

</p>
<p>
During the upgrade, the Security database, the Schemas database, and the configuration files are
automatically upgraded. The Security database is upgraded with the latest execute privileges and the
Schemas database is upgraded with the latest version of the Schemas used by MarkLogic Server. The
upgrade occurs as part of the installation procedure.

</p>
<p>
Databases that contain your own content are also upgraded; once you upgrade, you will no longer be
able to use that database with previous versions of MarkLogic.

</p>
<p>
NOTE
MarkLogic Corporation strongly recommends performing a backup of your databases
before upgrading. Additionally, MarkLogic Corporation recommends that you first
upgrade to the latest maintenance release of the major version of MarkLogic you are
running before upgrading.

</p>
<p>
For the procedure for upgrading, see Upgrading from Previous Releases. For details about known
incompatibilities, see What's New.

</p>
<p>
1.9. MarkLogic Converters Installation Changes Starting at
Release 9.0-4
MarkLogic Converters are used to convert Microsoft Office Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents,
as well as Adobe PDF files, to XHTML. MarkLogic filters are used to filter a variety of document
formats, extract metadata and text from them, and return XHTML. The following MarkLogic XQuery API
functions, described in the MarkLogic XQuery and XSLT Function Reference, provide this functionality:

</p>
<p>
xdmp:word-convert
xdmp:excel-convert
xdmp:powerpoint-convert
xdmp:pdf-convert
xdmp:document-filter

</p>
<p>
Converters/filters are also used as part of the conversion pipeline in Content Processing Framework.
For more details, see The Default Conversion Option in the Content Processing Framework Guide.

</p>
<p>
Prior to MarkLogic release 9.0-4, converters/filters were bundled and automatically installed with
MarkLogic Server. Starting with MarkLogic release 9.0-4, converters/filters are offered as a separate
package: MarkLogic Converters.

</p>
<p>
This change provides better flexibility and enables you to install/uninstall MarkLogic converters/filters
separately from MarkLogic Server.

</p>
<p>
With this change, MarkLogic Server does not include MarkLogic Converters. To use converters/filters,
install both packages: MarkLogic Server and MarkLogic Converters. An XDMP-CVTNOTFOUND error will
be thrown upon an attempt to use converters/filters on a MarkLogic node with no MarkLogic Converters
installed.

</p>
<p>
The version of MarkLogic Converters is synchronized with the version of MarkLogic Server. For
example, MarkLogic Converters 9.0-4 corresponds to MarkLogic Server 9.0-4 and may be installed
with it.

MarkLogic Server  MarkLogic Converters Installation Changes Starting
at Release 9.0-4

</p>
<p>
You can obtain the version of MarkLogic Converters installed on a node by calling to MarkLogic
server-side API function xdmp:host-status and examining the value of the converters-version
element in the response. If the converters package is not installed on a node, the convertersversion element will be empty.

</p>
<p>
MarkLogic Converters packages for all supported platforms are available for download at the same
location where MarkLogic Server packages are available, namely at http://developer.marklogic.com.

</p>
<p>
If you want to use the converters package with MarkLogic 9.0-4 or later, you will have to perform a
two-step installation: first install MarkLogic Server and then install MarkLogic Converters.

</p>
<p>
For details on MarkLogic Server and MarkLogic Converters installation for all supported platforms, see
Installing MarkLogic.

</p>
<p>
If you want to uninstall MarkLogic 9.0-4 or later, and if the converters package was previously installed
with it, you will have to perform a two-step uninstall: first uninstall MarkLogic Converters and then
uninstall MarkLogic Server.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
This section describes the following procedures to install MarkLogic on your system.

</p>
<p>
• Upgrading from Previous Releases
• Installing MarkLogic
• Starting MarkLogic Server
• Configuring the First and Subsequent Hosts
• Entering a License Key
• Checking for the Correct Software Version
• Configuring MarkLogic Server to Run as a Non-Daemon User
• Removing MarkLogic

</p>
<p>
2.1. Upgrading from Previous Releases
If you have previously installed MarkLogic on a machine, you must uninstall the old release before
proceeding with the new installation. For information on removing the software, see Removing
MarkLogic or the Installation Guide from the previous release. This section describes the following
information and upgrade paths:

</p>
<p>
• Windows Service Parameters
• Upgrading from Release 9.0-1 or Later
• Upgrading Clusters with DB Replication Configured

</p>
<p>
If you are upgrading a cluster to a new release, see Upgrading a Cluster to a New Maintenance
Release of MarkLogic Server in the Scalability, Availability, and Failover Guide. The Security database
and the Schemas database must be on the same host, and that host should be the first host you
upgrade when upgrading a cluster.

</p>
<p>
WARNING
MarkLogic Server does not support downgrades. Once you have upgraded to a later
release, you cannot downgrade to a previous version. To retain the option to restore to
a previous version of MarkLogic Server, make a complete backup of your content and
security databases before upgrading.

</p>
<p>
2.1.1. Windows Service Parameters
When you upgrade MarkLogic on Windows as a different user from the user that installed the
previous version, the MarkLogic service parameters in the Windows registry will be changed. When
the old version of MarkLogic is uninstalled, the service is deleted from the registry, including any
customizations to the service parameters. When the new version of MarkLogic is installed, the service
is re-created in the registry, with the default service parameters.

</p>
<p>
Before starting the upgraded version of MarkLogic, make any customization to the service parameters.
Otherwise, the default service parameters will be set and MarkLogic will start up running as the local
system user. Any MarkLogic configuration files saved as the local system user (such as those modified
when making changes in the Admin Interface) will be created with the Windows file permissions for the
local system user.

6. When the Admin Interface prompts you to upgrade the databases and the configuration files, click
the button to confirm the upgrade.

</p>
<p>
If you are upgrading a cluster to a new release, see Upgrading a Cluster to a New Maintenance
Release of MarkLogic Server in the Scalability, Availability, and Failover Guide. The Security database
and the Schemas database must be on the same host, and that host should be the first host you
upgrade when upgrading a cluster.

</p>
<p>
If you are upgrading two clusters that make use of database replication to replicate the Security
database on the master cluster, then you must enter the following to manually upgrade the Security
database configuration files on the machine that hosts the replica Security database:

</p>
<p>
http://host:8001/security-upgrade-go.xqy?force=true

</p>
<p>
WARNING
There is no direct upgrade path from Early Access releases to this release. If you need
to move any data from an Early Access release to this release, you must re-create the
data in the current release.

<p>
If you are upgrading a cluster to a new release, see Upgrading a Cluster to a New Maintenance
Release of MarkLogic Server in the Scalability, Availability, and Failover Guide. The Security database
and the Schemas database must be on the same host, and that host should be the first host you
upgrade when upgrading a cluster.

</p>
<p>
NOTE
It is not recommended to install the converters while MarkLogic Server is running.
The reason for this is that the server checks the converters presence and version
number only upon start-up. So, the server will not have accurate information about the
converters in this case. The recommended installation procedure is to stop the server if
it is running, install or upgrade the server, install the converters, then start the server.

</p>
<p>
The following table shows the installation directory (&lt;marklogic-dir&gt;) and the default data directory
for each platform:

</p>
<p>
Platform

</p>
<p>
Windows
Red Hat Linux
Mac OS X 

</p>
<p>
Installation Directory

</p>
<p>
c:\Program Files\MarkLogic\
/opt/MarkLogic
~/Library/MarkLogic 

</p>
<p>
Default Data Directory

</p>
<p>
for configuration and log files
c:\Program Files\MarkLogic\Data
/var/opt/MarkLogic
~/Library/Application Support/MarkLogic/Data

</p>
<p>
The default forest directory is the same as the default data directory if the optional data directory is
not specified during forest creation. On UNIX platforms, if you want MarkLogic Server to use another
location for its default data directory, make your data directory (/var/opt/MarkLogic on Linux) a soft
link to the alternate location.

</p>
<p>
In MarkLogic release 9.0-4 and later, MarkLogic Converters installation directory remains the same as
in previous releases, namely:

</p>
<p>
Platform
Windows
Red Hat Linux
Mac OS X 

</p>
<p>
Converters Installation Directory
c:\Program Files\MarkLogic\Converters
/opt/MarkLogic/Converters
~/Library/MarkLogic/Converters

</p>
<p>
NOTE
When a new node joins an existing cluster, the server does not try to figure out
automatically whether the MarkLogic Converters package is needed or not. An XDMPCVTNOTFOUND error will be thrown if converters/filters built-in functions are called on
nodes that do not have MarkLogic Converters installed.

</p>
<p>
2.3. Starting MarkLogic Server
MarkLogic Server will automatically start when the computer reboots. To start MarkLogic Server without
rebooting, perform the following command for the corresponding platform:

</p>
<p>
Platform

If your host is currently in a cluster of multiple hosts, and you would like to leave the cluster and switch
to a single host environment, follow the steps in this section.

</p>
<p>
A host cannot leave a cluster if there are still forests assigned to it or if it has any foreign clusters
associated with it. You must delete all forests assigned to the host and de-couple any clusters
associated with a host before you can leave the cluster. However, if you delete only the configuration
for a forest, the forest data will remain on the filesystem, allowing you to add the forest back to the host

</p>
<p>
2.5. Entering a License Key
MarkLogic will run without a license key, but after installing MarkLogic, you should enter a valid license
key for the usage and features for which you are licensed. At any time, you can change the license key
for a host from the Host Status page.

</p>
<p>
These are some reasons that you would need to change your license key:

</p>
<p>
• Your license key has expired.
• You need to use some features that are not covered by your existing license key.
• You upgraded your hardware with more CPUs and/or more cores.
• You need a license that covers a larger database.
• You require different languages.

</p>

2.7. Configuring MarkLogic Server to Run as a Non-Daemon
User
On UNIX-based systems (Linux), MarkLogic runs as the UNIX user named daemon. This section
describes how to change a configuration to run as a different UNIX user. This procedure must be run by
the root user. Additionally, the root user is still required for installing and uninstalling MarkLogic and
for starting and stopping MarkLogic from the startup scripts.

</p>
<p>
To modify an installation to run as a user other than daemon, perform the following steps:

</p>
<p>
1. In a command window on the machine in which you installed MarkLogic, log in as the root user.
2. Make sure MarkLogic is stopped. If it is still running, stop it as follows:

MarkLogic Server  Configuring MarkLogic Server to Run as a NonDaemon User

</p>
<p>
Platfrom
Red Hat Linux 
Steps
As the root user, enter the following command:

</p>
<p>
/sbin/service MarkLogic stop
3. Edit the configuration file for your platform using a text editor such as vi.

</p>
<p>
Platform
Red Hat Linux  /etc/marklogic.conf 

</p>
<p>
Configuration file

</p>
<p>
NOTE
You must create the /etc/marklogic.conf file if it does not exist. The file is
only read by the MarkLogic startup: it is never written to. Therefore, it will survive
uninstalling MarkLogic.

</p>
<p>
4. In the file /etc/marklogic.conf, add or edit the MARKLOGIC_USER environment variable to
point to the user in which you want MarkLogic Server to run. For example, if you want it to run as a
user named raymond, change the following line:

</p>
<p>
export MARKLOGIC_USER=daemon

</p>
<p>
to the following:

</p>
<p>
export MARKLOGIC_USER=raymond
5. Save the changes to the /etc/marklogic.conf file.
6. If you have not yet started MarkLogic after performing a clean installation (that is, after installing
into a directory where MarkLogic has never been installed), then you are done and you can skip
the rest of the steps in this procedure. If you have an existing installation (for example, if you are
upgrading to a maintenance release), then continue with the following steps.
7. For all of the MarkLogic files owned by daemon, you need to change the owner to the new user.
This includes all forest data and all of the configuration files. By default, the forest data is in the
following directories:

</p>
<p>
Platform  Configuration file
Red Hat Linux  /var/opt/marklogic
8. For example, on a Linux system, perform a command similar to the following, which changes the
owner to the user specified earlier in the /etc//MarkLogic.conf file:

</p>
<p>
chown -R raymond /var/opt/MarkLogic
9. Make sure to change the owner for all forests in the system; otherwise, forests will fail to mount
upon startup. Note that the above command only changes the owner for forests installed in the
default directory. You need to run a similar command on the data directory for each forest in which
a data directory is specified.
10. When you have completed all the file and directory ownership changes, start MarkLogic as
described in Starting MarkLogic Server.

</p>
<p>
Once you have performed this procedure, all new files created by MarkLogic are created with the new
user ownership; there will be no need to change any ownership again.

</p>
<p>
WARNING
On Linux systems, use the /etc/marklogic.conf script to set environment
variables. Any configuration changes you make to the MarkLogic-supplied startup
script (for example, /etc/sysconfig/MarkLogic) will not survive an upgrade and
need to be merged in during any upgrade of MarkLogic (because the installation
installs a new version of the startup scripts). Under Linux, the uninstallation
process saves an old version of the scripts (for example, /etc/sysconfig/
MarkLogic.rpmsave), so you can use that version to merge in your changes. If you
perform a clean installation (not an upgrade installation), however, you will need to run
this entire procedure again. If you use /etc/marklogic.conf for your environment
variable changes, they will survive an upgrade and you will not need to merge your
changes.

</p>
<p>
The following are default values of environment variables you can override in /etc/marklogic.conf
on Linux-based systems (you will have to create the file if it does not exist):

</p>
<p>
export MARKLOGIC_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/MarkLogic
export MARKLOGIC_DATA_DIR=/var/opt/MarkLogic
export MARKLOGIC_FSTYPE=ext4
export MARKLOGIC_USER=daemon
export MARKLOGIC_PID_FILE=/var/run/MarkLogic.pid
export MARKLOGIC_UMASK=022
export MARKLOGIC_DISABLE_JVM=0
export MARKLOGIC_EC2_HOST
export TZ=:/etc/localtime

</p>
<p>

NOTE
Using this procedure to remove MarkLogic from your system will not remove user
data (configuration information, XQuery files used by HTTP or XDBC servers, or forest
content). This data is left in place to simplify the software upgrade process. If you wish
to remove the user data, you must do so manually using standard operating system
commands.

</p>
<p>
In case you previously used converters/filters and want to remove this functionality:

</p>
<p>
• To remove MarkLogic Converters from a node that has MarkLogic 9.0-4 or later release installed,
you can use a package management tool, such as Control Panel on Windows or rpm on Linux, to
uninstall MarkLogic Converters.
• To remove converters/filters from a node that has MarkLogic 9.0-3 or earlier release installed, you
need to uninstall that release of MarkLogic, and then install MarkLogic Server from release 9.0-4 or
later but do not install MarkLogic Converters.
