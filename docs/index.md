The MarkLogic Spark connector is an [Apache Spark 3 connector](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/) that supports
reading data from and writing data to MarkLogic.

The connector has the following system requirements:

* Apache Spark 3.3.0 or higher; Spark 3.3.2 and Spark 3.4.0 are recommended to better leverage the connector's support 
  for pushing operations down when reading data.
* For writing data, MarkLogic 9.0-9 or higher.
* For reading data, MarkLogic 10.0-9 or higher.

Please see the [Getting Started guide](getting-started/getting-started.md) to begin using the connector.
