The MarkLogic Spark connector is an [Apache Spark 3 connector](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/) that supports
reading data from and writing data to MarkLogic.

This user guide describes how to obtain the MarkLogic Spark connector and use it with 
[PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html). The connector should be usable in a similar 
fashion with any other Spark runtime or environment.
