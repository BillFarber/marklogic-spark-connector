As of the 2.3.0 release, the MarkLogic Spark connector extends the out-of-the-box Spark capabilities for reading files
to include support for reading the following file types:

- Aggregate XML files
- RDF files
- ZIP files

Please see the guides below for more information on each of the above file types, as well as for using 
[Spark's Binary data source](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-binaryFile.html) to read any type
of file and write it to MarkLogic.
