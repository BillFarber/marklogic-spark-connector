The connector allows for data to be retrieved from MarkLogic as rows either via an  
[Optic query](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/app-dev/OpticAPI#id_46710) or via custom code written in JavaScript or XQuery, or as "document rows" where each row corresponds
to a document in MarkLogic. 

As of the 2.3.0 release, you can also use the connector to read files from a local filesystem, HDFS, or S3.

See the guides below for more information.
