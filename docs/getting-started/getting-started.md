This guide provides instructions on using the MarkLogic connector with multiple popular Spark environments. 
Before trying the connector in any of these environments, please [follow the instructions in the Setup guide](setup.md)
to obtain the connector and deploy an example application to MarkLogic.

For environments not yet listed here, the process for using the connector will typically involve determining how a 
connector JAR file is included in the Spark environment. Please see the documentation for your specific Spark 
environment for instructions on how to accomplish that goal.
