/**
 * This class exists in preparation for two events. First, upgrading to langchain4j 0.36.x will involve requiring Java
 * 17, and we don't yet want to force Flux users to use Java 17. Second, we may want to have marklogic-langchain4j be
 * a separate module that is available as a dependency. This class acts as a bridge, trying to instantiate the
 * langchain4j-specific class. If that's not on the classpath, that's fine - the splitter/embedder options simply won't
 * work.
 * <p>
 * At least for the 2.5.0 connector release, everything is being packaged together as we're sticking with langchain4j
 * 0.35.0 which only requires Java 11.
