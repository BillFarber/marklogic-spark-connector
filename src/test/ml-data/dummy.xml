  This document is loaded solely to ensure that it is not returned by any queries. For example, its presence
  ensures that if a test queries on the "/author/" directory, the test can safely verify that all 15 docs in the
  directory are returned and this one is not. Note that allTypes-data.json currently serves the same purpose, but
  it may be moved to another directory for some reason. This document has no reason to be moved and thus serves as
  an effective way of ensuring that a query doesn't return all documents in a database unless the query intends to
  do so.
